** Persona-Adaptive Customer Support Agent **

An intelligent AI-powered support agent that dynamically adapts its responses based on the customer’s persona (e.g., Frustrated User, Technical Expert, Business Executive).
It uses LangChain, OpenAI LLMs, and Chroma vector database to provide relevant, context-aware, and emotionally adaptive replies.

Project Overview
Goal
To build a Customer Support Chatbot that can:
* Detect the user's persona (emotion, tone, and expertise level).
* Retrieve relevant knowledge base (KB) information using semantic search.
* Adapt its response tone and style to match the detected persona.
* Escalate unresolved or critical issues to human agents with full context.
