# 🤖 Persona-Adaptive Customer Support Agent

An intelligent **AI-powered support assistant** that dynamically adapts its responses based on the **customer’s persona** — such as *Frustrated User*, *Technical Expert*, or *Business Executive*.  

It leverages **LangChain**, **Gemini LLM**, and a **Chroma Vector Database** to deliver **context-aware**, **emotionally adaptive**, and **persona-aligned** responses for smarter customer interactions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 🎯 Goal
To build a Customer Support Chatbot that can:
- 🧠 Detect the user’s persona — analyze tone, sentiment, and technical depth of queries.  
- 🔍 Retrieve relevant **knowledge base (KB)** content using semantic search.  
- 💬 Adapt its response tone and style based on persona (*empathetic*, *formal*, or *technical*).  
- 👥 Escalate unresolved or critical issues to human agents with full conversation context.
